This Currenct project was about recreating the google landing page. I have been able to demostrate the basic skills required to build a a webpage using html and css i.e. creating the header, body and footer.
Building a simple input form for capturing the search purpose. styling the web page by placing the items in the rigft places etc.
It was reallly fun trying out the different style properties to acheive the desired look and feel.
